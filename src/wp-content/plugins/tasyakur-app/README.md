# tasyakur-app
> Tasyakur Main App WP Plugin

## Getting Started

This is a micro-framework for tasyakur app WP backend. Everything should be done within this plugin.

It uses PSR-4 and OOP logic instead of procedural coding. Every function, hook and action is properly divided and organized inside related folders and files.

`/tasyakur-app.php` is the entry point file, which is where the WP calls this plugin from, hence it is used to bootstrap the app.

`/inc` is the app main folder.

This documentation will mainly tell about the app structure and patterns.

The main pattern this app uses are MVC and Service Pattern.

Also some other patterns are like: Adapter and Strategy.
