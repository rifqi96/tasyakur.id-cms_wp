This plugin allows to manage Zend OPcache inside your WordPress admin dashboard.

== Description ==

This extension adds a button in your admin area to flush OPcache easily. It supports both memory and file caching transparently.
If this is a multisite installation, it only shows up in network admin dashboard.
There is a submenu page with all statistics about OPcache. There is an option to automatically flush OPcache when a WordPress or plugin update occurred.
The statistics tabs relies on https://github.com/wp-cloud/opcache-status
If you want to add a translation in your own language, you can use flush-opcache.pot located in languages folder and send me by email.

== Installation ==

As usual...

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does I need to have OPcache activated on my server to use this plugin? =

I think the answer is in the plugin's name ;)

= Do I need to know something before install this plugin? =

Yes, If you're working on a shared server, OPcache is shared across all PHP users so when you flush OPcache, you do it on every websites this server hosts.
Nothing related to this plugin, it's just the way Zend OPcache works... This plugin only triggers `opcache_reset()` function.

== Screenshots ==
